# Public Safety Council City Wide Meeting
## The Public Safety Zone Council City Wide Fall Meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, October 17, 2018.

### The meeting will be held at The Pittsburgh Project, located at 2801 N Charles St, Pittsburgh, PA 15214.

### The subject for the event will be centered around human trafficking, child luring/internet stalking/abuse and various modern day slavery activities such as indentured labor in the greater Pittsburgh area.

### The only beverage we will be serving is bottled water. This was condition by the site as they have just had installed new carpeting.

#### This would also be an ideal time to solicit your elected officials for their support and assistance as well.
