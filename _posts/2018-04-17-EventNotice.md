## Statement from Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich 
(Pittsburgh, Pa) April 18, 2018 -- 

Statement from Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich:

“The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police receives information daily that we evaluate and prepare for if the event should occur.  Events can include anything from extreme weather to potential demonstrations.

“Often the events we prepare for do not occur. However, through an abundance of caution, we attempt to adequately prepare for an appropriate response.

“We receive information regularly about potential events and/or threats, assess the credibility of the information and plan for a potential event. In this case, we have not assessed the credibility of the potential for disturbances, and we do not have any knowledge of the President’s decision-making process.”
