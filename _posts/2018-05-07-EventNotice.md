### Zone Public Safety Councils are resident led, community public safety groups whose mission is to enhance the safety and quality of life for residents and businesses within each of Pittsburghâ€™s six police zones. The Zone Councils work closely with residents from other neighborhoods throughout the police zone, police and all public safety personnel to promote strategies that will mitigate resident safety concerns.  
Zone Commanders and officers, other public safety staff and guest speakers round out the agendas every month.  
Meetings are open to all residents served by Pittsburgh Police Zone 6. Please plan to attend our monthly meetings and to bring a neighbor!
