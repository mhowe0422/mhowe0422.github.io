# City EMS presentation of 2 Hand CPR and AED
## Discussed that the suggested method is to use 2 hands for CPR and not to have mouth to mouth contact.
## This is to keep the blood following to the brain.
## Make sure that the person is in need of CPR by trying to get their attention and they are unresponsive.
## Start CPR and have someone call 911
## Continue CPR until medical personal arrive and take over.
## It is helpful to have multiple people do CPR as it is a tiring process.
## Follow in your minds the Bee Gee's "Staying Alive" for the beat
## If an AED is available, follow the automated instructions from the machine.
