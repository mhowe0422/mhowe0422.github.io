# Child Abuse presentation by Joan Reed Mills and Richard Mullen

### Joan Reed Mills and Richard Mullen explained what they do to assist abused children via the
agency A Childs Place. Joan explained that if you see an adult or someone in authority beating
the heck out of a child in public; ask yourself what they are doing to that child in private. They
are not saying that you can’t discipline your child, but you cannot beat and abuse and
humiliate them. Joan shared some of the horrific stories that have happened to children here
in Allegheny County. Joan also let us know that by the time a case makes it to Court, that a lot
of care has been put in due to the age, and nature of some of the crimes that they deal with. 

### Richard Mullen, showed a Power Point presentation regarding issues of child abuse and
answered such questions relating to grooming a child or teen for sexual abuse, what is the
definition of a child, mental abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, the age that a teenager can
legally consent to consensual sex in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It was shared that
90% of victims know their abusers. We were advised if a child is aware of a sexual act, then
it’s a very good possibility that the child is being abused. Most children while afraid will not
tell on their abusers due to fear of being removed from the home. Physical abuse is hard to
prove if the child is afraid, but if you know something, then please say something or call 800-
932-0313 if you believe that a child or teen is in imminent danger. We were also educated on
the abuse called “Munchausen by Proxy” which entails the sickness of a parent or a caretaker.
Richard also talked to us about intentional abuse that is also dangerous to a child or teen i.e.
not buying food and instead buying drugs and allowing your children to go without food and
clothes or just basic necessities. Abuse is reported mostly by concerned citizens and doctors
are the lowest when it comes to reporting abuse. If you see a hungry child or a child getting
into trouble, don’t talk about the child… pick up the phone and get the authorities involved as
most children are acting out what they see at home.
