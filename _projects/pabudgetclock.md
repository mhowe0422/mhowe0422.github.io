The Pennsylvania State Budget Clock counts the number of days that the state has gone without a budget. Some background information and news articles about the lack of the budget are provided. Of course, if there is a budget (and there was at the time this was posted), then there won't be a clock!

This project is based on one created by [Chi Hack Night](http://chihacknight.org/), Chicago's Code for America brigade.
