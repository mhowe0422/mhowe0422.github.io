In 2017, years of vehicular [crash data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data) was released by Allegheny County.

Mark Howe pulled together a Police Blotter-inspired Bicycle [Crash Map](https://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/BikeCrashMap) and [Crash Heat Map](https://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/CrashHeatMap)

Bike Pittsburgh later released a [thorough report](http://www.bikepgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BikePGH-crash-report.pdf) (pdf link) on the trends found in the data, and CMU's Metro21 launched a series of transport-themed events, including [Transportation Camp](http://transportationcamp.org/events/pgh-2016/) in November 2016.
