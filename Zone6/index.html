            They have numerous open data sources: You can start here
            <a href=https://data.wprdc.org/dataset>WPRDC</a>
            <br>

            This links to 30 days of Police Blotter Incidents

            Code for Pittsburgh is a Brigade of Code for America that works with government to aid opening up data to the public.

            Code for Pittsburgh has a Web site
            <a href=http://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/>Code for Pittsburgh</a>
<br>
        Under projects you will find Police Blotter at
        <a href=http://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/PoliceBlotterDaily/>Police Blotter Daily</a>
<br>
    I get my Police Blotter data from
    <a href=https://communitysafety.pittsburghpa.gov/Blotter.aspx>City Police Blotter Site</a>
<br>
    and updates from the wprdc

    This only has one day's worth of data, and I try real hard to make sure it's current by 9am for yesterdays incidents. (my automation has failed in the past couple of days)

    This evolved to the City's own Informational page
    <a href=https://pittsburghpa.shinyapps.io/BurghsEyeView/>City's own Informational page</a>
<br>
And finally, the City's main site
<a href=http://pittsburghpa.gov/index.html>City's main site</a>
<br>
I also work on these:
A quick Ad -- Fish Fry Map
<a href=https://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/fishfrymap/>Fish Fry Map</a>
<br>
and Bike Crashes
<a href=http://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/projects/bikecrashes/>Bike Crashes</a>
This data is updated once a year from the State; March/April time frame. So we should have updates soon.
